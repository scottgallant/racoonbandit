<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Praise for Racoon Bandit:</span></strong> <em>&#8220;Their sound has elicited comparisons to such East Coast indie rock peers as the revered Sloan and Thrush Hermit, and their excellent new album Close Your Eyes justifies that.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewCanadianMusic" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=213685182077848">NewCanadianMusic</a></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Like Joel Plaskett on an ayahuasca binge&#8230;Close Your Eyes accomplishes the two things every album should strive for: It leaves the listener wanting more, and wondering where they left their dealer’s phone number.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>The summery, washed-out production lends the album’s more contemplative moments like &#8216;Believe Me&#8217; and &#8216;Second Chance&#8217; even more warmth and emotional heft.&#8221;</em> &#8211;<strong>AUX-TV</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Catchy&#8230;.moving&#8230;I couldn’t get enough of the harmonies, and found myself singing along. 4/5 Stars.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <strong>Canadian Beats</strong></p>
<p><em>&#8220;Delightful, positive pop vibe with sweet vocal work&#8230;there is an easy-going vibe to some of these tracks, yet they also dig themselves into your brain and make a welcome home there.&#8221;</em> &#8211; <strong>Michael Doherty music blog</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Soaring harmonies mixed with a blend of folk and rock that find an irresistible happy medium between the two…a band with a killer amount of potential.</em>” – <strong>Musicnerd.ca</strong> “<em>Sprawling East Coast indie rock.</em>” – <strong>Beatroute</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“<em>Racoon Bandit show a knack for warm folk-rock arrangements that hide an anthemic bite; something that goes smoothly next to daydreamed campfires and docks at sunset…The lyrics, mood and scope of this band hugs at the very nature of being Canadian.</em>” –<strong> Skeleton Crew Quarterly.</strong></p></blockquote>
