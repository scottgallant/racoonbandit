**Praise for Racoon Bandit:** _“Their sound has elicited comparisons to such East Coast indie rock peers as the revered Sloan and Thrush Hermit, and their excellent new album Close Your Eyes justifies that.”_ – [NewCanadianMusic](https://www.facebook.com/NewCanadianMusic) 

_“Like Joel Plaskett on an ayahuasca binge…Close Your Eyes accomplishes the two things every album should strive for: It leaves the listener wanting more, and wondering where they left their dealer’s phone number.”_

“_The summery, washed-out production lends the album’s more contemplative moments like ‘Believe Me’ and ‘Second Chance’ even more warmth and emotional heft.”_ –**AUX-TV**

_“Catchy….moving…I couldn’t get enough of the harmonies, and found myself singing along. 4/5 Stars.”_ – **Canadian Beats**

_“Delightful, positive pop vibe with sweet vocal work…there is an easy-going vibe to some of these tracks, yet they also dig themselves into your brain and make a welcome home there.”_ – **Michael Doherty music blog**

“_Soaring harmonies mixed with a blend of folk and rock that find an irresistible happy medium between the two…a band with a killer amount of potential._” – **Musicnerd.ca** “_Sprawling East Coast indie rock._” – **Beatroute**

> “_Racoon Bandit show a knack for warm folk-rock arrangements that hide an anthemic bite; something that goes smoothly next to daydreamed campfires and docks at sunset…The lyrics, mood and scope of this band hugs at the very nature of being Canadian._” –\*\* Skeleton Crew Quarterly.\*\*
