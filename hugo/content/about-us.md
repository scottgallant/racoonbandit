Racoon Bandit show a knack for warm folk-rock arrangements that hide an anthemic bite. Equal parts roots, pysch-rock, and indie, the quartet turned heads across the country this year with their third independent release "Close Your Eyes." The album was featured on several Best of 2015 lists, including Mixtape Magazine‘s Top-9 East Coast albums and Top-45 Canadian records of 2015. The album also picked up a 2016 East Coast Music Award nomination for Rock Recording of the Year and 3 Music PEI nominations.

The band is comprised of Fraser McCallum, Adam Gallant, Roger Carter, and Colin Buchanan, with former member Scott Gallant also contributing songwriting and performance to "Close Your Eyes." In the vein of fellow East Coast stalwarts Sloan & Thrush Hermit, the Bandits share songwriting and lead vocal duties, bringing a dynamic sound and performance to their three records and to the stage.

RB's latest release is co-produced with Colin Buchanan (Paper Lions; Coyote, SORREY) and features songwriting from all members and contributions from Kinley Dowling, Allison Kelly, Jill McRae, Buchanan, and more. Second single ‘On the Hook’ hit #1 on the East Coast Countdown after climbing for 7 weeks, and the full-length album charted across Canada. A video was released for the latest single "Second Chance" in October 2016.

The Bandits' arrangement and recording of Dick Blakeslee’s protest song ‘Passing Through’ (included as the closing number on "Close Your Eyes") was featured as the opening theme for the award-winning Canadian web series Just Passing Through. Currently the band is working on new songs and planning additional Maritime shows.

**Praise for Racoon Bandit:**

– Canadian Beats

> "Soaring harmonies mixed with a blend of folk and rock that find an irresistible happy medium between the two…a band with a killer amount of potential.”

– Musicnerd.ca

> "Like Joel Plaskett on an ayahuasca binge…Close Your Eyes accomplishes the two things every album should strive for: It leaves the listener wanting more, and wondering where they left their dealer’s phone number.”

– AUX TV

> "‘Hold On To Your Hat’ is a pure hit.”

– Grant Lawrence, CBC Radio 3

> "Propelled by upbeat folk rock elements and charming pop rock flare, the new single ‘You Got Into It’ foreshadows an exciting and noteworthy indie rock album, once again from the underrated East Coast music scene.”
